# JengaStackTestTask
The goal of the task was following:
Get data from an API call about stacks and blocks,
Sort the data based on categories, than names than ids,
Create multiple jenga stacks based on "grades" and assign the correct blocks
Create a physics system where each block is a physics object and a function to remove glass blocks to see if the stack falls,
Create a system to display more information about a specific block.
